# Dave Carroll

I started my career over 28 years ago at a small Mom-and-Pop computer store building and repairing home computer systems and peripherals.
Since then, I've worked in the public and private sectors with 17 years in higher education.
Currently, I am a DevOps engineer for a finance company and use PowerShell and Python daily.

I got into scripting early.
First just DOS batch files, then VBScript.
Around 2009, I learned my first bits of PowerShell converting my homegrown identity management system consisting of more than 10,000 lines of VBScript and interfacing with Active Directory, SunOne LDAP, Oracle DB, MySQL, and more.
I enjoyed wowing coworkers (and myself) with the data I could collect and collate using just a few commands of PowerShell.
It has allowed me to control the systems I manage and interface with various others.

I attempt to promote and evangelize PowerShell, helping new learners with the basics and participating in the online community as often as I can.
I am most active on Twitter [@thedavecarroll][MyTwitter], but you can also find me on [LinkedIn][MyLinkedIn], in the [PowerShell Forums][PowerShellForums], and (less occasionally now) in the [r/PowerShell subreddit][PowerShellReddit].

I've recently joined the [Fediverse][Fediverse] and can be found on the [Mastodon][Mastodon] instance [@fosstodon.org/@thedavecarroll][FosstodonMe].

Also, I have recently gotten into retrocomputing so you may see some content focused on that.
The first computer I owned was a Commodore 64, but I would spend more time on my Apple //c that I received a couple years later.
My first IBM compatible laptop had an impressive 640K RAM, which I configured part of as a RAM disk, and dual 1.44MB floppy drives.
